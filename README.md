DESCRIPTION : This Java program demonstrates how to consume a public REST API using HttpURLConnection.
It sends an HTTP GET request to the Agify API to predict the age based on a given name.
The response is read from the input stream and stored as a JSON string.
Basic string operations are used to manually parse the JSON data.
Finally, the extracted values (name, age, and count) are displayed in a structured format.
